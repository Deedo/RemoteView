RemoteView
==========

Yet another Telemachus frontend. Only Chrome is supported.

Just copy the dir remoteview in .../Kerbal Space Program/GameData/Telemachus/Plugins/PluginData/Telemachus/

and go to http://127.0.0.1:8085/telemachus/remoteview/index.html


TO DO:



Manage target orbits when inclination matters ;)

Show SOI switches (is telemachus report them ?)

Show manoeuvre nodes (is telemachus report them ?)

other displays (-electricity-, thrust, compass, TAC)

Manage hyperbolic orbits (can do better)
